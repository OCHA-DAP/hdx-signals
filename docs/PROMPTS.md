# AI summarization
 For datasets where text information is publicly available, OpenAI's [GPT-4o large language model](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) is used to generate summary content for signals, to provide additional context to the quantitative data and visualizations generated by the system. Publicly available text data from primary datasets and linked secondary sources is aggregated and passed to GPT-4o to produce key headlines (short summaries) and situation summaries (long summaries) for each signal.

 Refer to the `src/indicators` source code to see what information is passed to the AI for summarization. Below you can find the prompts passed to GPT-4o to generate the summary text.
