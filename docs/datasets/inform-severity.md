# INFORM Severity Index

Signals are sent when the national level INFORM Severity Index is above 3 and exceeds the highest value recorded in the past 12 months.  

## Source
We monitor the [INFORM Severity Index (ACAPS)](https://www.acaps.org/en/thematics/all-topics/inform-severity-index) data. The INFORM Severity Index is a composite indicator designed to measure the severity of humanitarian crises globally, against a common scale. It aggregates data from various sources to categorise all crises into five levels of severity:

- *Level 5*: Extreme humanitarian conditions. People are facing extreme shortages or availability and accessibility problems in regards to basic services.
- *Level 4*: Severe humanitarian conditions. People are facing significant shortages and/or significant availability and accessibility problems in regards to basic services.
- *Level 3*: Moderate humanitarian conditions. People are facing shortages and/or availability and accessibility problems in regards to basic services but they are not life-threatening.
- *Level 2*: Stressed humanitarian conditions. People are facing some shortages or/and some availability and accessibility problems in regards to basic services. 
- *Level 1*: None/Minor humanitarian conditions. People are facing none or minor shortages or/and accessibility problems regarding basic services. 

People with identified humanitarian needs are included in levels 3â€“5, depending on the severity of their needs.

You can access ACAPS data directly on [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/organization/acaps) and find additional datasets and context on the [ACAPS website](https://www.acaps.org/en/).
## Signals detection
The INFORM Severity Index is calculated for each crisis covered. In order to generate Signals at the country level, we aggregate crisis-level data to the national level. Signals are sent when the national level INFORM Severity Index is above 3 and exceeds the highest value recorded in the past 12 months.  

#### Examples
Below are historical examples that show how signals are generated using the INFORM Severity Index:  
[Nigeria](http://eepurl.com/jaCrHc#NGA): In January 2025, the INFORM Severity Index reached 4, a value higher than any time in the previous year.  
[Malawi](http://eepurl.com/jaCrtg#MWI): In May 2024, the INFORM severity index reached 3.6, the highest value in the previous year.
