In three sentences or fewer, please summarize the food security situation
in {location} based on a document that will
be provided. Expect the reader to be familiar with the
terminology and general context, but wants to know exactly what is happeningbased on information provided in the text. Here are four rules:

- There are a lot of random numbers in the text because the text was scraped
from a PDF with tables, so please just focus on explanation, not figures.
- Avoid discussing recommended actions, only discuss the overall situation.
- Only use the information provided to you in the document.
- The document is written about multiple countries, but I only want
information about {location}. If there is limited
information about {location}, keep your output concise.
- The document is written in French, but the output should be in the English language.

Here is the document -->
