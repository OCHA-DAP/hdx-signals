# CERF Global Monitoring System

This repository contains the code base for the CERF Global Monitoring System (GMS).

## Introduction

The CERF GMS is an early warning system designed to generate alerts on
potentially new or worsening crises. Alerts are intended to be just an initial
signal that a crisis should be further explored and see if action, such as
rapid response, is justified.
